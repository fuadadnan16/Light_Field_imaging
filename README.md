# Light Field Imaging Studio (C++ / OpenCV)

An interactive **Light Field Imaging Simulator** implemented in **C++** using **OpenCV**.  
This project reconstructs and visualizes light-field data from a plenoptic mosaic and allows **real-time refocusing, aperture control, and all-in-focus rendering**.

The software is designed as a **research-oriented interactive tool** for computational imaging and light-field analysis.

## 🔍 Overview

Light-field imaging captures both **spatial** and **angular** information of light rays, enabling post-capture operations such as refocusing and aperture manipulation.

This project demonstrates:

- Sub-aperture view extraction from a plenoptic mosaic
- Shift-and-sum based digital refocusing
- Synthetic aperture control
- All-in-focus image generation via sharpness-weighted fusion
- Interactive visualization using a **single-window GUI**

---

## 🖥️ Software Interface

### Main Application Window

The entire application runs inside **one unified window**, similar to professional imaging tools.

The window contains:
- Sub-aperture mosaic view
- Refocused image view
- Aperture sweep view
- All-in-focus output
- Interactive sliders for focus and aperture

## 🔭 Digital Refocusing Results

The refocus slider controls the synthetic focus depth using a **shift-and-sum** approach across sub-aperture views.

### Near Focus

### Mid Focus

### Far Focus

These results demonstrate the ability to refocus at different depths **after image capture**, a key advantage of light-field imaging.

## 🔵 Aperture Sweep Simulation

The aperture slider simulates changing the effective camera aperture by averaging sub-aperture views within a selected angular radius.

This enables:
- Depth-of-field control
- Background blur variation
- Synthetic bokeh effects

---

## 🧠 All-In-Focus Imaging

An **all-in-focus image** is generated by:
1. Building a focal stack across multiple depths
2. Computing local sharpness using high-frequency energy
3. Performing sharpness-weighted fusion

This produces an image where all depth regions appear simultaneously sharp.
